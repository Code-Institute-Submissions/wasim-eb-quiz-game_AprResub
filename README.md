## Testing

* The website was also tested live on a Samsung Galaxy 10 and iPhone 12 with great success. 
* Finally, I tested the webpage on the Responsive Design platform, also with great success. 
* The works well in function and in looks.


## Bugs
Encountered an error when typing in the questions in the javascript. 'Maximus didn’t want it' was causing me problems because of the extra ‘’ ‘ ‘’, was disturbing the code . I fixed this problem by changing the sentence into ‘Maximus did not want it’.
I later realised that this issue can also be resolved by adding a single dot to the sentence, that way it won’t interfere with the code.

## Validator testing:

* Most of my coding was used by myself. 
* I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) as my main source for codes. I also had to make a lot of google searching for the javaScript content.
