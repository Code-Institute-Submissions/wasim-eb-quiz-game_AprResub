## Technologies Used
I have used several technologies that have enabled this design to work:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
    - Used as the basic building block for the project and to structure the content.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)
    - Used to style all the web content across the project. 
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - Used for the responsive navbar, animated heading, quiz functionality & sound effects and high-scores leaderboard.
- [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
    - Used as a primary method of fixing spacing issues, finding bugs, and testing responsiveness across the project.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Used as the development environment.
- [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/)
    - Allowed me to test the colour contrast of my webpage.
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    - Used to validate all HTML code written and used in this webpage.
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
    - Used to validate all CSS code written and used in this webpage.
- [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
    - Used to generate responsive image used in README file.



## Features:
* Questions tab
* Answers tab, showing three possible answers.
* A button to submit your answer
* Scores at the end of the quiz


## Pages: 
There is only one page for this simple quiz-game. 

## Testing
* I am happy to confirm that the website if very responsive on different browsers, such as Google Chrome (which I used to type the code), Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer. 
* The website was also tested live on a Samsung Galaxy 10 and iPhone 12 with great success. 
* Finally, I tested the webpage on the Responsive Design platform, also with great success. 
* The works well in function and in looks.


## Bugs
Encountered an error when typing in the questions in the javascript. 'Maximus didn’t want it' was causing me problems because of the extra ‘’ ‘ ‘’, was disturbing the code . I fixed this problem by changing the sentence into ‘Maximus did not want it’.
I later realised that this issue can also be resolved by adding a single dot to the sentence, that way it won’t interfere with the code.

## Validator testing:

* The end result shows no errors in the HTML code. Check the results here: [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwasim-eb.github.io%2Fquiz-game%2F)
* The CSS code is is also validated. Check the results here: [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwasim-eb.github.io%2Fquiz-game%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
* No errors were found neither in the HTML nor the CSS code. 
* I used lighthouse in the dev tools in Google Chrome to confirm the accessibilty on both mobile devices and desktops.

## Credits

### Coding content
* Most of my coding was used by myself. 
* I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) as my main source for codes. I also had to make a lot of google searching for the javaScript content.
* I had to go back a few times and look at older coding from my previous project and I also used some codes from the Love Maths project.
